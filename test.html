                    There are two Ayahs in Surat An-Nur that describe the relationship between the creator and the
                    creature
                    of the first verse,
                    describing the light God gives to all his creatures.
                    <br> “Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche
                    within
                    which
                    is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the
                    oil
                    of] a blessed olive tree......”
                    <br> And the second verse describes all the creatures as they go to the creator with praise and
                    glory
                    <br> "Do you not see that Allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and [by]
                    the
                    birds
                    with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and exalting [Him],
                    and
                    Allah is Knowing of what they do."
                    <br> This is the governing law of that interactive relation between creator and creature
                    <br> The mercy is from the creator to the creature and the souls are shining to the creator by
                    glorifying.
                    <br> The structure of our mosque consists of this duality:
                    <br> “Descending mercy vs. flying souls”
                    <br> light shining from a narrow nozzle, filling the place and a structure of crystal flying
                    towards
                    the
                    light.
                    <br> (like a swarm of birds flying upward towards the light)
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>

                    <strong>duality of soul and body </strong>
                    <br>This duality , which represents the most important dilemma in human life which is weighed in
                    between
                    his body that connects him to his physical world and his spirit that attracts him to his creator.
                    This
                    duality was expressed in the construction of this mosque on three faces;
                    <br> Dark and Light: a majestic semi-enclosed envelope has been built from the opaque-controlled
                    sides
                    and
                    has an upper middle slot from which the light is carried out to disperse the darkness.
                    <br> Opaque and translucent material: The mosque consists of a coarse and enclosed outer crust with
                    a
                    bright
                    transparent crystal-glass heart.
                    <br> Duality of ascend and descend : The light descends from the top of the mosque from the upper
                    main
                    slot
                    and in return the glass composition rises from bottom to top.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Basic generative unit</strong>
                    <br> Moqarnas & Origami The clarity of the basic unit of the mosque construction is a fundamental
                    foundation
                    in the traditional mosques and is a fundamental basis in the construction of all natural systems.
                    There
                    is always a permanent basic cell that constructs the natural system. That living organic principal
                    has
                    been the ruler of all mosques in different cultures all over the world.
                    <br> The basic unit of our current mosque, is inspired by the Moqarnas in Islamic civilization and
                    the
                    art
                    of Origami in Japanese civilization, both of them have a special secret, mystery and beauty.
                    Perhaps
                    the source of this magic lies in its ability to reshape itself according to geometric rules that
                    look
                    magical and belong to the same dynamic organic world. It is the principles of generative geometry
                    that
                    are not bounded by any boundary and has no limits.
                    <br> The basic unit of our mosque, which forms the fabric of the crystalline fabric that symbolizes
                    the
                    flying
                    swarm of birds, is in fact the abstraction of the flying shape in the art of origami that has been
                    assembled
                    and re-fitted repeating several times to form this annexure swarm of crystals in the form of a
                    majestic
                    but transparent composition that is carried out through the light and reflects the basic idea of
                    the
                    mosque which is the dialogue of the light and flying birds.

                        and
                        has an upper middle slot from which the light is carried out to disperse the darkness.
                        <br> Opaque and translucent material: The mosque consists of a coarse and enclosed outer crust
                        with
                        a
                        bright
                        transparent crystal-glass heart.
                        <br> Duality of ascend and descend : The light descends from the top of the mosque from the
                        upper
                        main
                        slot
                        and in return the glass composition rises from bottom to top.

                        <strong>Basic generative unit</strong>
                        <br> Moqarnas & Origami The clarity of the basic unit of the mosque construction is a
                        fundamental
                        foundation
                        in the traditional mosques and is a fundamental basis in the construction of all natural
                        systems.
                        There
                        is always a permanent basic cell that constructs the natural system. That living organic
                        principal
                        has
                        been the ruler of all mosques in different cultures all over the world.
                        <br> The basic unit of our current mosque, is inspired by the Moqarnas in Islamic civilization
                        and
                        the
                        art
                        of Origami in Japanese civilization, both of them have a special secret, mystery and beauty.
                        Perhaps
                        the source of this magic lies in its ability to reshape itself according to geometric rules
                        that
                        look
                        magical and belong to the same dynamic organic world. It is the principles of generative
                        geometry
                        that
                        are not bounded by any boundary and has no limits.
                        <br> The basic unit of our mosque, which forms the fabric of the crystalline fabric that
                        symbolizes
                        the
                        flying
                        swarm of birds, is in fact the abstraction of the flying shape in the art of origami that has
                        been
                        assembled
                        and re-fitted repeating several times to form this annexure swarm of crystals in the form of a
                        majestic
                        but transparent composition that is carried out through the light and reflects the basic idea
                        of
                        the
                        mosque which is the dialogue of the light and flying birds.
