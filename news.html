                    describing the light God gives to all his creatures.
                    <br> “Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which
                    is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly [white] star lit from [the oil
                    of] a blessed olive tree......”
                    <br> And the second verse describes all the creatures as they go to the creator with praise and glory "Do
                    you not see that Allah is exalted by whomever is within the heavens and the earth and [by] the birds
                    with wings spread [in flight]? Each [of them] has known his [means of] prayer and exalting [Him], and
                    Allah is Knowing of what they do."<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                    <br> This is the governing law of that interactive relation between creator and creature The mercy is from
                    the creator to the creature and the souls are shining to the creator by glorifying.
                    <br> The structure of our mosque consists of this duality:
                    <br> “Descending mercy vs. flying souls”
